"A day after BJP’s oldest ally Shiromani Akali Dal pulled out of the Modi government to protest against the legislations meant to restructure agricultural trade, and amid continuing opposition from Congress and some other parties, PM Narendra Modi went on the offensive on Friday and called the bills a “historic” pro-farmer measure and dismissed the resistance as having been engineered by “middlemen”.",0
He also assured farmers procurement of their produce under the minimum support price (MSP) regime would continue.,0

Second, battery will be an important component.

It starts with creating artificial shortage, following which demand for pirated textbooks and textbooks of private publishers shoots up. Even half the total requirement is never printed by the time the academic session begins. The printing continues even well beyond December. It is no surprise that NCERT meticulously stonewalls its real-time data related to the status of printing of textbooks. And any action against the piracy is mere eyewash. Generally, before any raid is actually conducted based on any complaint, the erring printers are alerted by these officials.”",0

"After a bumpy start to the crop production season due to lockdown restrictions and the current spurt increase in Covid positive cases, farmers and experts have mixed reactions to the upcoming harvesting stage.",0
"“The harvest of Rabi crops, besides cashew and mango was successfully done by farmers during the lockdown. Now for paddy they will have to rent harvester machines for the harvesting. One of the perks of mechanised harvesting is that the cost of labour comes down,” director of ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute, EB Chakurkar said.",0
"“This monsoon season has brought heavy rain which has made the fields difficult to tread in. The harvester can manoeuvre through the paddy fields only if there is a dry spell,” said farmer, Satish Tendulkar.",0
"Sanjeev Barve, a Valpoi farmer, who is keen on harvesting his arecanut and coconut crop said, “I can purchase the equipment through schemes of the directorate of agriculture.",0
"However the machines must be operated by someone. For coconut climbing especially, experience is more important than technology.”",0
"Farmers are also trying to figure post-harvest tasks without incurring a loss. A Valpoi farmer who annually produces about 3,000 litres of feni was forced to discard the cashews from his farm this year as he didn’t have enough resources and labour for the distillation. “We had a big problem when the lockdown was announced during the peak cashew season. Though things have normalised now, we hope that we are able to market our produce without problems,” he said.",0

"Eight opposition members of the Rajya Sabha were suspended for a week on Monday for ""unruly behaviour"" during passage of the two farm bills on Sunday, with Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu also rejecting the notice for a no-confidence resolution against deputy chairman Harivansh.",0
"The eight MPs, including Trinamool leader Derek O’Brien and Sanjay Singh of the Aam Aadmi Party, however, continued with their protests and refused to leave the House despite repeated instructions from the chair. It led to multiple adjournments, with the proceedings being washed out without any business being transacted on Monday.",0
"The other MPs are Rajeev Satav, Syed Nasir Hussain and Ripun Bora of Congress, Dola Sen of Trinamool, and K K Ragesh and Elamaram Kareem of CPM. Expressing deep anguish, Naidu said, ""It pained me a lot because what happened (during passage of the farm bills on Sunday) was unfortunate, unacceptable and condemnable. It was a very bad day for the Rajya Sabha.""",0
"He said some members, violating all Covid-19 physical distancing norms, came to the well of the House, climbed on the secretary general’s table and broke mics, while also hurling papers and the rulebook at the deputy chairperson. ""Are these parliamentary standards?"" he asked.",0
"While the opposition decided to protest the suspensions and call on President Ram Nath Kovind, this is the second such suspension of a significant number of MPs in recent years. In 2010, seven MPs — four from the Samajwadi Party, one each from JD(U), RJD and LJP — were suspended for fracas during passage of the women's reservation bill. The code of conduct adopted by the House in 2005 lays down several guidelines relating to behaviour of members.",0
"Naidu said Harivansh later informed him that he was abused with objectionable words, physically threatened and could also have been harmed. ""If the marshals had not been called on time, what would have happened to the deputy chairperson? I am worried,"" he added.",0
"If the opposition — which wanted voting on a resolution to send the two farm bills to a select committee — had the numbers, they should have voted. The deputy chairman repeatedly requested the members to go to their seats, participate in the debate and move amendments. ""Obviously, in view of the continuous disruption, division could not have taken place,"" Naidu said.",0
He also rejected the resolution moved by leader of the opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and 46 other members for Harivansh’s removal because it was not in the proper format and without the requisite 14-day notice.,0
"Minister of state for parliamentary affairs V Muraleedharan moved a motion for suspension of the eight MPs for gross disorderly conduct, especially with the chair, and ""bringing disrepute"" to the House. It was adopted by voice vote amid continuing protests from the opposition.",0
"The protesting MPs, however, did not leave the House despite being asked by Naidu to do so. O'Brien, in fact, had earlier in the proceedings also refused to leave the House after Naidu named him.",0
"Following the railway ministry decision to impose user charge fee on the existing rail ticketing system with a view to increasing its revenue for development work to be carried out at all major railway stations (including Ludhiana), members of several rail unions in the city have raised their voice against the same. They claim that 90% travellers in all trains are from economic weaker sections of society and would not be able to bear the increasing charges on existing ticketing system. So, the railways will have to look for some other option to increase their revenue for conducting development work on the station premises.",0
"Speaking on this issue, Gaurav Sharma, a local member of Northern Railway Mazdoor Union, said that, “In the name of conducting the much required development work at all major stations of the country, the railway ministry has taken the decision of increasing charges on the existing rail ticketing system in the next few months, which is cause of concern among members of all unions in country as the railway is pressurising middle class families, which mostly travel in trains for reaching their destinations.",0
"“Members of our union are against the railway ministry decision to go in for privatisation of the railways by signing a contract with a big private firm to manage maintenance works of all stations and reducing involvement of the railway authorities by ending jobs in several departments. The railways give huge employment to lakhs of young people of society every year but with involvement of private companies not only the number of jobs will be reduced, but the salaries of workers will also get cut.”",0
"Another member of the same union Ashok Kumar said that, “The railways is running private trains on different routes after giving freehand to private companies in restricting the employment rate, which is totally an unfair practice because the railways is a government body and they should not put the fate of lakhs of workers in the hands of private firms.”",0
"“The railway ministry should take back this decision as it’s against the welfare of common people as the railways is main source of transportation for middle class families and the government should continue to run it as its responsibility instead of allowing private players to enter the management of the department,” he added.",0
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said his government was committed to taking the country’s over six lakh villages into 21st century and, therefore, providing digital infrastructure (optical fibre) to link every village with internet connectivity and increased road communication network.",0
"The PM said this after launching from Delhi the project to link over 6 lakh villages in the country, including 45,945 in Bihar, with optical fibre, besides laying the foundation stones for nine road and mega bridge projects worth Rs14,260 crore as part of his Rs1.65 lakh crore “PM package” announced for Bihar during electioneering in 2015. It included Rs54,000 crore for the roads – four-laning of national highways and construction of mega bridges.",0
He said it was only the Atal Bihari Vajpayee led NDA government at the Centre and his own that has stressed on the development of infrastructure in the country.,0
"Accordingly, coming a day after the passage of the agriculture reform Bills by Parliament on Sunday, PM Modi hailed the launch of the digital infrastructure project to be completed in the country in the next 1,000 days and the laying of foundation stones for the road and bridge projects in Bihar. He called it a “historic day”.",0
"“The previous governments did not think in totality. They just believed in constructing one road here and one bridge or railway station there. That was their vision with regard to the development of infrastructure,” Modi said.",0
"“Today, the stress is being given on multi-model connectivity. When the road or any infrastructure is laid, the underlying focus is to link it with ports and airports, besides giving connectivity to the villages, as it will help the farmers to get fast access to markets to sell produce,” he added.",0
"Accordingly, he asked the farmers not to get persuaded by them. He also assured them that their right to the possession of land would prevail, while the mandis and the minimum support price (MSP) would also not be done away with.",0
"Without mentioning the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, Modi said, “The agriculture reforms Bills had become a necessity to take Bihar into the 21st century. The old laws had kept enchained the hands and feet of the farmers. The powerful people took advantage of them, but now the same powerful people have been eliminated from the scene, as the farmers will be able to assess the market through internet to sell their produce anywhere in the country and get right price.",0
"He said the agriculture Bills were not against farmers and asked them to constitute farm producers organisations (FPOs) and enter into agreements with the companies to get higher income on the produce. There have been instances of farmers of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan getting 20-30% more money on their produce, while those in MP, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal had got 25-30% more money on pulses, he added.",0

"Offering to hold talks with farmers to clear apprehensions about the farm bills, BJP on Thursday accused Congress of ""double-faced"" politics and said Rahul Gandhi should first disassociate his party from its 2019 election manifesto in which it had promised what the Modi government has done.",0
"At a press conference, senior BJP leader and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated the government's commitment to farmers' welfare and said the new measures would bring them remunerative prices for their produce.",0
"Tomar said the government was open to holding talks with farmers. ""If any farmer wants to speak to any government representative on these bills even at midnight, we are ready,"" he added.",0
He claimed that opposition members' criticism during debates was never about the provisions of these proposed laws but on things they did not have or other unconnected issues.,0
"Reacting to the demand that there should be a law to ensure that farmers are not paid less than the minimum support price when the proposed laws come into force, he said MSP was always an administrative decision of the government and would remain so. ""Why did Congress not bring a law during its 50 years of rule if it thinks this was necessary?"" he asked.",0
"He also cited reports of various commissions and reported views of Sharad Pawar, who was agriculture minister in the UPA government, to assert that the farm bills were in line with their recommendations.",0
"Asked about Rahul’s charge that the Modi government had harmed farmers and was now doing ""PR"", Tomar said the Congress leader should first withdraw his party's manifesto if he wanted to oppose these bills. If he agreed with the Congress manifesto of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then he should join efforts in educating farmers, he added.",0
"Congress was ""misleading"" farmers and practising ""double-faced"" politics, he said, adding that this would weaken the party and the nation as well.",0
"Highlighting the Modi government's pro-farmers policies, he said it had given Rs 7 lakh crore to them through purchase of their produce in its six years in office, which was more than double of the UPA's 10 years. Tomar said good people had ceased to matter in Congress, and those leading it had ceased to matter in the country.",0
"“Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab, there's 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these bills, farmers will be able to sell their produce even outside the ambit of the mandi, even outside their state at any price they choose,” Tomar said.",0

Vadodara BJP MP Ranjan Bhatt Bhatt said in the Lok Sabha that the palace was gifted to the railways by the family of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad and it was a heritage building with a large campus around it. She pointed out that the tall building would overshadow the palace and its beauty would be lost forever. She demanded an alternative site should be selected for the project.,0
"Bhatt shared her speech she made during the zero hour in Lok Sabha on her social media account. Controversy over the new building surfaced in July this year when the Gaekwad family started an online petition against it.

Uplinks and downlinks are quite often transmitted through open telecom security protocols that can be compromised.

"A 2019 report released by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said while India demonstrated its A-Sat interceptors, China — which had done the same in 2007 — has capabilities to mount sophisticated cyber-attacks directed at ground stations with the intent of either corrupting or hijacking the systems used to control spacecraft/satellite.",0

However, the state government is promoting private practitioners who have made a hub here opposite the medical college,” he claimed.",0

This government is only halting the developmental work started by us with no valid reason affecting the common people. Work on the Rs 1,000 crore mega dam project here has been halted on petty issues. Similarly, the Kissan Bazar started by us here as an integrated model for the benefit of the farmers has today lost its real purpose because of the reluctance of the present government.”",0

"Conditions here probably are the most difficult for me ever in Roland Garros for so many different factors. Ball completely different. Ball is super slow, heavy. It's very cold. Slow conditions.Of course, the preparations have been less than usual. But you know what, I am here to fight and to play with the highest intensity possible, to practise with the right attitude, to give me a chance. That's the main goal for me.""",0
"Halep, who opens against Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo, will look to build on her momentum, coming off two clay-court titles, Prague and Rome, in the lead-up to the French Open. But the 28-year-old, like the 12-time men’s winner Rafael Nadal, enjoys playing in the sun, when the bounce is good. Feeling the spark.",0
"Just as well that the Philippe Chatrier court’s retractable roof will make its debut this fortnight, giving organizers a chance to allow play late into the evening. Rain is forecast for six of the first eight days of the two-week event. The tournament, which was postponed from its initial late spring slot to autumn, when days are shorter and rain spells longer, will also have plenty to cope with. Like the players.",0
"“I love this tournament. I love this place. But it is a little bit too cold,” Halep, who has gone through the drill on the practice courts after arriving in the French capital, said. “Every time I play on these courts, I feel they are a little bit harder and the ball bounces a little bit more. The conditions are good for me.”",0
"Muguruza, the 2016 French Open winner, who plays Tamara Zidansek in the first round, doesn’t care about the weather or for that matter which month the tournament is being played.",0
"“I’m not surprised because also in April, when the tournament is normally played, can be like this. I played many years where the tournament was a little bit rainy,” the 11th seed said. “I know it’s going to be tricky. But I’m excited to be here. I look at it in a positive way, the fact that they can still make another Grand Slam happen.”",0
"The in-form Halep can return to the No. 1 ranking for the first time since January of 2019 and overtake Ashleigh Barty if she wins her second Roland Garros title over the next fortnight. World No. 1 Barty, the defending champion in Paris, has chosen to skip the event like she did the US Open.",0
"“I know that most of the players are favourite because everyone is working hard, everyone is ready for this tournament,” she said, adding: “I’m used to this kind of pressure because I’ve been in this position. I take it in a right way, I take it as a normal tournament.”",0
"Halep, who didn’t play the US Open courtesy Covid-19, filled in fans on her fitness schedule during the pandemic.

"“It’s high time we should stop depending on them. Badminton has stars like PV Sindhu, Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth. We should look for other sponsors. Yonex used to pay a pittance to Sindhu and Srikanth but when they switched to other sponsors they got 10 times more. BAI should think on those lines,” another official said..",0

"I think it is the right and prerogative of every participating country to decide if they want to travel to play or not, he told media at an event in Kuala Lumpur, according to The Star on Thursday.",0
"There are lots of things to be taken into consideration because each country imposes different SOP (standard operating procedures), rules and conditions for their citizens travelling abroad.",0

"Doctors involved in Covid treatment say this can be yet another indicator of community spread of the virus. Brought dead patients testing positive means the deceased were living with Covid, and unknowingly infecting others, and were only detected when they were tested after death.",0

For the remainder of the day, the buses were running nearly empty, they added.",0
"Disruptions in service have also led to low commuter confidence. Soon after resumption of service, the buses went off the roads for two weeks in July after the government imposed a shutdown.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday asked the State director general of police Shubodh Jaiswal to ensure similar open Covid treatment facilities for cops across the state on the lines of Nagpur and Satara police.

"The facility, started with the initiative of CP Amitesh Kumar within a week of his taking charge, is set to act as ‘transit’ for the ailing cops requiring hospitalization. Around 15 personnel of city police have so far died of Covid and more than 800 have been infected.",0
"Kumar was assisted in the efforts by Jt CP Nilesh Bharne, DCP Gajanmane and chief medical officer of police hospital Dr Sandeep Shinde. Police have also tied up with renowned radiology and pathology laboratories, apart from entering into a tie-up with Indian Medical Association for running the facility.",0
"Deshmukh said such dedicated facilities for the police are required in every city and district of the state given the number of personnel testing positive crossing 20,000 mark and 222 having already succumbed to the disease. “Our cops maybe physically exhausted but their morale is still high,” he said.",0
Guardian minister Raut praised the police as ‘Covid yoddhas’ for having guided and secured the people since the Covid outbreak.,0
"CP Kumar said he had taken up the responsibility ever since home minister Deshmukh had expressed desire to see dedicated Covid facility is developed in the city during a review meeting. “Around 10% of personnel have been affected. With shortage of beds in city, we had to have a facility where the patients and their family members can be stabilized until hospital beds are arranged,” he said.",0

Many Covid-19 recovered patients like Sheetal are facing a range of health issues depending on the severity of the disease they experienced earlier. Doctors in Nagpur acknowledged that more than 80% patients are recovering from Covid in Nagpur but many of them are experiencing some or the other health issues.,0
"Recovered and discharged patients are experiencing symptoms including continued loss of taste or smell, irregular heartbeats, chest pain, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, cognitive problems, and recurring fever months after the infection, said doctors.",0
"“But the number of patients re-reporting with any serious symptoms to the hospitals is negligible,” said consulting physician Dr Mohan Nerkar.",0
"TOI had earlier reported that patients recovering from Covid-19 are reporting with problems like lung infections. One such patient was admitted to IGGMCH last month. While lung fibrosis is a comparatively serious complication, many others with general weakness, pain and uneasiness prefer to be at home and take rest instead of visiting hospitals again.",0
"“At IGGMCH, we have started a separate Covid OPD for the patients who have been recovered but still have health complications. The OPD timings are from 2 pm to 4pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

"“About 15% need hospitalisation and, among those, more than 5% need intensive care or ICU. The increase in numbers and viral load has worsened the situation. There are times when we now have to refuse patients in need. We can only stabilise them before they are sent to another care centre,” said a senior consultant with Hamidia hospital.",0
A number of other factors to deal with in Bhopal is the increase in number of infections among doctors and support staff. Around 200 doctors have tested positive for the infection in the recent past. Seven days’ leave after two weeks of intensive duty is now a thing of the past in medical colleges due to the shortage in medical staff.,0
As many as 296 people tested positive for the novel coronavirus and one died in three western Uttar Pradesh districts on Tuesday.,0

"Salunke said the team's main focus is ensuring rural hospitals are self-sufficient with enough oxygen beds. This is being done to reduce load on city facilities, he said. “Across Junnar, Baramati, Indapur and other talukas, district hospitals will have to have enough oxygen beds and trained specialists. Moreover, oxygen supply at all these hospitals needs to be regulated and monitored by authorities,"" he told TOI on Wednesday.",0
"Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said advisories have also been sent out to district hospitals to increase the number of oxygen beds. “Some private hospitals too have been provided help to increase bed numbers,” he said.",0

"To know how it felt and what changed, Timesofindia.com got in touch with the coach of the Red Lions, Shane McLeod, for an exclusive interview.",0
We also create the expectation of a new normal for the group.,0
Athletes need to have targets to look forward to and there is no better way to do this than playing other nations.,0
How many days before the matches against Germany did you get together as a group?,0
This means that the need to bring the group together before playing a match does not need to be for a long period.,0
"We travelled the morning before we played, as it is only a two-hour distance from where we train.",0
What do you prefer as a coach?,0
"In normal circumstances, we would travel a week to ten days before a tournament so that we get used to the time zone, conditions and climate; but for the Pro League, this is not practical.",0
"When we do travel and are in camp, it is a great way to bring the group to another level, playing-wise, and also as a team.",0

"Without a crowd, it is very hard to not get the feeling of it being a training match.",0
It just shows that we are social creatures.,0
You won the first game against Germany comprehensively but then were held to a 1-1 draw in the second.,0
What changed?I think that playing two games back to back is an interesting experience.,0

"""We were able to resume activities because of the early measures taken by Hockey India who ensured a Hockey SOP was in place as early as April.

"Mr. Schwab said as India focuses on building a better future after the pandemic, “its greatest opportunity probably lies in its efforts to leapfrog to a more digital and sustainable economy“.",0

"Next on the list were Yanam in Puducherry, Bikaner in Rajasthan, Diban Valley in Arunchal Pradesh and Pali in Rajasthan.",0

The move is likely to put financial burden on parents of 77 lakh students as they have to buy new uniform.,1

"At a time when government school students are worried about missing classes because of lack of infrastructure for online education, even a discussion on the colour of uniforms is untimely and inappropriate.",1

"But analysing the data in the past couple of months, experts in the field pointed that one of the reasons for the high joblessness is the impact of the pandemic on tourism and hospitality sector.",1
The fact that tourism contributes 23% to the state’s GDP pretty much explains how the state is overly dependent on the sector and why it is necessary for the state diversify its economy and de-risk it.,1
"However, industry feels that economic activity in the state went into a slump couple of years ago and the revival has remained elusive since then.",1
They attribute to partly to the general slowdown in the country which was aggravated by the state’s own problems.,1
"After tourism, real estate has a big impact on job creation and the sector’s underperformance contributed to the joblessness in a major way.",1

"In a politically significant statement, he also indicated that he would stand by Chirag's decision on alliance and seat sharing for the Bihar assembly polls.",1
Chirag Paswna's run-in with the government in the state began in March this year when he embarked on a ''Bihar First Bihari First'' campaign which was viewed with suspicion by the JD(U).,1
"The relationship between the two parties had nosedived in the subsequent months with the LJP chief taking potshots at the JD(U) government over its handling of Covid-19, the migrants crisis that followed the lockdown and the insistence on holding assembly elections, scheduled in October-November, on time despite the raging pandemic.",1

"Modi's praise of alliance partner Kumar came weeks ahead of the elections that are likely in October-November, as he dedicated three petroleum projects worth nearly Rs 900 crore to people.",1
"In his trademark style, the prime minister began his speech with a few sentences in Angika, the dialect spoken in Banka and adjoining districts.",1

"Launching a veiled attack on RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who he did not mention by name, Modi said Bihar has come out of an era when rail, road and internet connectivity were made light of and people used to say of what use roads are for those who walk on their feet.",1
"Being a land-locked state, Bihar was obviously at a disadvantage when it came to availing petroleum projects.",1

"Interestingly, the ceiling on expenditure by a candidate in Lok Sabha/assembly poll may also see a revision in the long term, with EC mulling setting up a committee led by its senior officer, to revisit the poll spending limit for all future polls in view of the country's total electorate having grown by 1.1 times from 834 million to 921 million and cost inflation index going up 1.37 times from 220 to 301 between 2014 and 2020.",1

"KXIP were all out for 132 in 16.5 overs to slump to a 69-run loss, their fifth defeat -- and fourth on the trot -- in six matches to remain at the bottom of the IPL points table.",1
KXIP made a disastrous start to their run-chase as they lost two wickets inside five overs.,1
"In-form Agarwal (9) was run out in a horrible mix-up with Rahul (11) in the second over itself, while Prabhsimran Singh looked promising for a while before getting out for 11.",1
"""When we lose wickets in the powerplay, it's gonna be tough, especially when we're playing only six batters. Getting Mayank run-out wasn't the ideal start; it was a disaster,"" a disappointed Rahul said in the post-match presentation.",1
"KXIP made amends of their woeful death-overs bowling by conceding just 41 runs in the last five overs and taking six wickets in the process, with leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3/29) triggering a batting collapse of SRH.",1
"Rahul was full of praise for his bowlers, saying: ""The last five games we struggled with our death bowling, but that was a positive today. The boys showed courage and pulled things back. You expect them (SRH) to score 230-plus after that start.""",1
The KXIP skipper also lauded Nicholas Pooran (77 off 37 balls) for his lone effort with the bat and young Bishnoi's bowling display.,1
"Winning captain David Warner, who made 52 off 40 balls and shared a 160-run opening stand with Jonny Bairstow (97), admitted that he was little nervous when Pooran was going all guns blazing in the middle at one stage.",1
Warner praised Rashid Khan for his impressive 3/12 spell,1
"West Indies batting great Brian Lara is impressed with Rishabh Pant's much-improved off-side play, which he believes will add dimension to his game making him an a much well-rounded batsman in days to come.",1
"The 23-year old Pant has had fair degree of success for Delhi Capitals in the ongoing IPL, having scored 171 runs in five games with a strike-rate of nearly 140.",1
"Lara said that Pant has realised that he was becoming a one-trick pony with shots only on the on-side, something that has changed",1
"""I think he has come to realise that this is not working and he went away and worked on improving his off-side play,"" said Lara, one of the greatest to have ever graced the cricket field.",1
"""Now look at the changes he made. Now, he has the ability to score runs on all parts of the ground. His scoring charts are looking impressive, and yes, more worry for the bowlers,"" said the elegant former West Indies left-hander.",1

"India's Test stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara, who on Friday completed a decade in international cricket, has thanked his fans for their love and support during all these years as he became the national team's dependable number three batsman in the traditional format.",1
"Pujara, who made his Test debut against Australia in Bengaluru, had an impressive first outing as he scored 72 in the second innings in India's successful 207-run chase.",1
The 32-year-old's biggest hour of glory has been the 2018 tour of Australia where he scored over 500 runs to guide India to their first (2-1) Test series win Down Under in 71 years.,1
He also left a cheeky little note informing another reason to remember the date.,1
"Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer said he thought his team had put up a below-par total against Rajasthan Royals but the Sharjah wicket, known for producing bagful of runs, was on the slower side and that worked in their favour on Friday.",1

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday joined BJP leaders criticising his Jharkhand counterpart Hemant Soren’s “distasteful” remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s telephonic conversation with the chief ministers of the Covid affected states.,1
"Senior BJP leader from Assam and head of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), Himanta Biswa Sarma, slammed the Jharkhand CM for his “disrespectful” tweet towards the Prime Minister.",1
"BJP MP from Deoghar, Nishikant Dubey, reacted scathingly, saying, ""In my entire life, I have not seen a Chief Minister of such a poor mentality, who is not ashamed to speak so lightly about the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister called the state chief minsters to take stock of people’s well-being and you (Soren) is making downmarket comments against the prime minister.Learn to respect the dignity of the post you are holding.""",1
"Soren's reaction came after Modi spoke to him and the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Telangana about the Covid-19 situation on Thursday.",1
"The Congress fared poorly in these elections, failing to win back Assam and Kerala and losing in Puducherry.",1
"The barb, aimed at the Congress leadership, has takers within the party as insiders are terming the debacle in five state polls as yet another wake up call and it may soon be too late.",1
The gloating in Congress over the BJP’s defeat in West Bengal is riling many as it is seen to ignore the GOP’s own dismal show.,1
The raging concern in Congress is that the party is again slinking away from investigating the defeat in Kerala and Assam because it may point fingers at leaders who are in key positions in the organisation.,1
"That the opposition alliance secured more votes than ruling BJP combine in Assam is being cited as evidence that there is need to sharpen poll strategising, arguing that introspection is not to apportion blame but to upgrade the skillsets within.",1
"Barring a handful of constituencies, the saffron party retained much of the gains it had made in 2016.",1
BJP’s surge was not unexpected.,1
"Congress, which stitched together the Mahajot of nine parties, came under blistering attack along communal lines for tying up with Badruddin Ajmal’s AIUDF.",1
"The Citizenship Amendment Act, which had triggered statewide street protests in 2018 and 2019, did not make much of an impact either.",1
"However, the other prominent figure from that ideological block, Akhil Gogoi, the peasant leader who has been in jail for nearly two years for campaigning against CAA and faces anti-terror charges, scripted a remarkable battle from prison to handily defeat his BJP rival.",1
Congress faltered.,1
Both men are popular figures with the latter almost single-handedly building the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance of the small states of the region.,1
There was also tiredness with the older Bodo leadership which had been continuously in office for 15 years.,1
"The fight against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), demand for an error-free National Register of Citizens (NRC) and implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord for the safeguard of the state’s indigenous people will continue, despite the BJP-led Mitrajot’s victory.",1
"NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee emerged “Didi No. 1” scoring her best mandate so far, beating back the formidable force of BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, a feat that can put her at the forefront of any anti-BJP mobilisation ahead of the next Lok Sabha elections.",1
Banerjee faced the onslaught with hordes of TMC leaders being weaned away by the saffron camp creating a situation that suggested it was a sinking ship.,1
"As the battle-lines grew sharper and BJP’s offensive got louder, the TMC chief fought head on, campaigning in almost every seat.",1
"With many of her MLAs facing anti-incumbency but her own popularity refusing to die down on the ground, Banerjee’s campaign also saw a direct hit at Modi and Shah.",1
The personal attacks on Mamata only brought out the best in her supporters who seemed determined to counter it.,1
"While Congress, Left and others were washed out in Bengal’s TMC wave, Banerjee faces a new challenge in BJP emerging as the main opposition.",1
"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's decision to more or less skip the state, initially out of tactical reasons and later ostensibly due to the Covid pandemic, was also read as conceding space to Banerjee in some way.",1
"With Bengal done, Mamata Banerjee is all set to start working on an opposition unity to challenge BJP at the Centre, as the main fulcrum of any movement geared towards 2024 Lok Sabha polls.",1
"KOZHIKODE/KOTTAYAM: Ever since the cobbling together of United Democratic Front (UDF) in Kerala in 1970 in the lone Christian pocket in Muslim-majority Malappuram, the front has become the political platform for minority communities that amount to 45% of the electorate.",1
"The political experiment helped shape UDF’s rainbow political base, bringing together the bulk of Muslims mostly concentrated in Malabar (26.6% as per 2011 census) and Christians based in central Kerala (18.4%) and aligning them with Congress’ traditional anti-Marxist vote base spread across various communities.",1
LDF seems to have sensed minorities warming up to it and was enthusiastic in supporting the mass agitations against CAA/NRC.,1
"Also LDF’s big win cannot be possible without the support of the church, especially in central Kerala.",1
The church was agitated for some time with UDF for the prominence it gave to IUML.,1
The stand of Jacobite Church made Chandy sweat though he won Puthuppally.,1
"Standing atop his van, brandishing a brick, Udhayanidhi, DMK chief M K Stalin’s son, thundered, “I have brought Madurai AIIMS with me,” a battle cry that went viral.",1

"Deaths continued to surge with 4,135 fatalities reported on Saturday, nearly as high as the previous day's record toll of 4,187.",1
The fact that these districts are spread across 31 of the country’s 36 states and UTs reveals how widespread the current surge in Covid infections is.,1
